# BloodCell_Classifier

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project focuses on **image classification** of eight different blood cell types using 96x96 RGB images. The goal is to design a versatile deep learning model capable of achieving high accuracy while exploring the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art techniques. The project employs **transfer learning**, **data augmentation**, and **fine-tuning** to optimize performance on a limited dataset.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like **RandAugment** and **class-specific augmentation** were used to improve generalization and handle class imbalance.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models like **EfficientNetV2S** were used to leverage existing knowledge and reduce training time.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The base model was fine-tuned to adapt to the specific task of blood cell classification.
- **Oversampling**: The dataset was balanced by oversampling underrepresented classes, improving model performance.
